# Hello-World
This repository is created for the purpose to store my first program in Git-Hub named Hello-World.

My name is Tim, I'm now studying how to use GitHub by following the guides of this great website.
Talking of my target, I use GitHub to help me establish a C# program. The program, I believe, will be finished soon with my exceedlingly passion with it.
